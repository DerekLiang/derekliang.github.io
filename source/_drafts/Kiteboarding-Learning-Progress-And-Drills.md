I started learning kiteboarding when I was taking vacations in Sydney Austrialia. Kiteboarding is a sport that looks very simple. But the complexity is hidden under the surface. Like software engineering, complex stuff can always be broken down into simple concept, I believe that same will work for the kiteboarding.

# Controlling the trainning kite
The following drills will help you fly the training kite well. It probably takes up to 8 hours of drill. It worthes the effort. 
  * launch trainning kite with help
  * understanding the power zone and bring the kite in the power and up
  * making figure 8 in the power zone
  * making figure 8 in the left, and right of the power zone
  * keep your eyes off the kite (like talking to someone), move your body( like touching your toes while fly the kite) and repeat the above steps
  * repeat the above steps with only one hand at time try both hand
  * fly reverse figure 8 and repeat above steps
  
# Controlling the real kite
The following drills with a real kite. You do the drill on the water close the shore. Make sure that when you crash landing the kite, you want the kite to be on the water, so that you can practice launch kite from water. You can use the one size smaller kite that will not lift you out of water.
  * get familar with additional kite control namely pull and push.
  * float in the water (feet not touching the sea floor) and repeat same drill of the training kite.
  * body drag downwind
  * body drag upwind
  
# Working with board
  * water start and stop smoothly in both directions downwind
  * go up wind in both directions
  * turn left and right
