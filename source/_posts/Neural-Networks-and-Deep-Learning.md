After through first part of the FastAI lessons, I am ready to dive deep into the how the deep neural networks. So I started go over some of the things that I grossed over.

In the lesson 2 wiki notes, there is a link that point to a web site `Neural Networks and Deep Learning` by Michael Nielsen. It introduced the same concept that Jeremy taught in the FastAI lessons but front different angle. It explained well the reasons behide deep learning and introduce the related concepts. For example it explanes very well why we are doing stochastic gradient descent instead gradient descent, and what is mini-batch in the context. Overall it creates a solid theoretical foundation for me to move further down the deep learning path.
