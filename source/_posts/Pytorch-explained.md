Just read the following article, and clear some doubts about the programming model of PyTorch. As some of the HackerNews comments pointed out, TensorFlow is low-level API that can scale to 10K machines while the strenth of PyTorch is easily to learn and GPU accelerated on single node. Thanks for the article.
